	<p> These are my layered portrait, which I made in Photoshop. The image on top was the one I made for myself and the bottom one was for interviewee from my project. One of the skills I learned in this project was layering images. When I layered my images I made the more important images bolder while the less important pictures were a bit more translucent.</p>
